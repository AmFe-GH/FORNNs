This repository contains the code to replicate the results presented in the paper "Caputo Fractional Order Recurrent Neural Networks". 

## Files

- `FORNN_ABTheta.ipynb`: This is the main file. Running the code in this notebook in sequence will reproduce the results reported in the author's paper.
- `Hyperparameters.py`: Contains preset parameter information used in the experiments.
- `LDN.py`: Implements the Local Domain Normalization method described in the paper.
- `model.py`: Includes model architectures and loss functions used in the experiments.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used in the main file.

## Instructions

To replicate the results:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run `FORNN_ABTheta.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment, following the instructions provided in the notebook.

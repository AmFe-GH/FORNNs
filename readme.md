This repository contains the code to replicate the results presented in the paper "Caputo Fractional Order Recurrent Neural Networks". 

## Files

- `main.py`: This is the main file. Running this file can fully demonstrate the generation and processing of training data, as well as the learning process and results of FORNNs.
- `Hyperparameters.py`: Contains preset parameter information used in the experiments.
- `LDN.py`: Implements the Local Domain Normalization method described in the paper.
- `model.py`: Includes model architectures and loss functions used in the experiments.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used in the main file.

## Instructions

To replicate the results:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   `git clone https://github.com/AmFe-GH/FORNNs`
2. Enter your conda environment:   
   `conda activate <your_env_name>`
3. Install the required packages:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `main.py`.
